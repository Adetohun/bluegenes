## Tools folder

This folder is only for tool-api compliant tools.

Any file/folder matching the pattern bluegenes** is automatically ignored by git.

To install a tool, run `npm install NameOfYourTool`. This assumes you have a
recent version of [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (you can check by running `node --version`). A full list of tools is on npm under the tag
[bluegenes-intermine-tool](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:bluegenes-intermine-tool).
